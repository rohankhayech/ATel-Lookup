Functionality: Downloads HTMLs using Selenium

Requirements: Google Chrome browser and corresponding ChromeDriver

This does not work in the docker environment since it requires a browser and web driver to load the web pages and extract
their HTMLs but it can be used as a guide to find solutions.

ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
(Once downloaded, place the executable inside the importer folder)
