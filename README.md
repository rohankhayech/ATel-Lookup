<h1>ATel Lookup</h1>

The ATel Lookup application is a powerful and comprehensive web-based search interface that allows users to intelligently query reports from The Astronomerâ€™s Telegram by object name and location. It also displays timeline and graph visualisations that will help astronomers and the general public better understand celestial objects, events and their relationship. 

The application was developed as part of a final year Capstone project at Curtin University. The development team that has worked on the project over the semester consists of three Computer Science students; Rohan Khayech, Ryan Martin and Nathan Sutardi, Software Engineering student, Greg Lahaye and Cyber Security student Tully Slattery. With the team built-up with students from multiple majors, our specialised skills were put to great use over the course of the project, covering both front and backend development, user interface and algorithmic design and security considerations.  

The project was commissioned by researcher Dr. Arash Bahramian and Director of Science, Professor James Miller-Jones at CIRA, the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy. CIRA consists of a multi-disciplinary team of both engineers and scientists focused on the field of radio astronomy.
